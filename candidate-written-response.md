### what I think of this exam.
I think the exam is very suitable as an interview. It is easy to understand because it is mostly about one component.
And it can also test my ability to design the UI, the data format of React state, and the interaction between parent and child components.
I am having fun with this exam.

### challenges
* The first challenge is the Unit testing. I haven't used the testing tool 'enzyme' before,
but through this exam I learned how to use enzyme + jest to test components.
* The second challenge is the right-click mouse event. I seldom deal with the mouse right-click
event before, it takes me some time to figure out.
* The third challenge is the update of array state. I keep the stage tasks in a two-dimensional 
array which needs to be updated when user create new task or click one task. At first I tried to update the array state
but it is not updating. After searching for answers through Google, I found that the array indexes always point to the same 
elements even if I change the length of each element. So to solve this, I decided to create a whole new array every time I need an update.

### If I had more time
If I had more time, I would be able to make the unit testing perfect, to test every possible use cases and even to check if the task names are matching.
